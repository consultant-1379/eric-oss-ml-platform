# OSS OSS ML Execution Environment Pre-Code Review Pipeline

> **âš  WARNING**: This pipeline is not yet in place for eric-oss-ml-execution-env

Pipeline used to analyze and build the commits made in com.ericsson.oss.ami/eric-oss-ml-execution-env
defined in `ci/jenkinsfiles/precode.Jenkinsfile`.

## Flow
### Declarative: Checkout SCM
- Checks out the commit from Gerrit

### Clean Workspace
- Cleans anything that might be left over from previous pipeline runs, e.g. test reports, .tgz files, etc.
- Cleans the workspace using `git clean`

### Package Helm Charts
- Packages the Helm chart and saves it as `eric-oss-ml-execution-env-0.0.0-0.tgz`

### Validate Helm3 Chart Schema
- Validates the Helm chart using the schema
- Scans the helm-chart-validator testsuite `site_values.yaml`

### Validate Helm Chart Schema
- Validates the Helm chart using the schema

### Build Helm Testsuite Image
- Builds a Docker image to be used for tests
  - `docker build <PWD>/<testsuite-dir> --tag <testsuite-image-name>:latest`

### Run Helm Chart Testsuite
- Runs the Helm testsuite using the Docker image created in the previous step
  - `docker run --name <testsuite-image-name> -v PWD/eric-oss-ml-execution-env-<chart-version>.tgz:/eric-oss-ml-execution-env.tgz <testsuite-image-name>:latest`
- After the testsuite has run, a test report is generated inside the Docker container. This is copied out and stored in `PWD/chart-test-report.html`
- The container is then removed.
  - `docker rm -f <testsuite-image-name>`

### Python Lint Utilities
- Python linting using Pylint for the Python files in the Gerrit commit
- Skipped when no Python files have been changed

### Kubernetes Range Compatibility Tests
- kube-version
  - Runs script to store supported Kubernetes versions in a file
- kubeval
  - Runs kubeval against the oldest and newest supported kubernetes version
  - Checks that each `.yaml` file in the chart is valid
- deprek8ion
  - Runs deprek8ion against the supported minor Kubernetes versions
  - deprek8ion monitors Kubernetes APIs deprecations

### Design Rules Check
- Runs Helm design rules

### Check shell scripts
- Runs shellcheck against the scripts in the Gerrit commit
- Skipped when no scripts have been changed
